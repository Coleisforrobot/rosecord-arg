# Rosecord ARG

On Wednesday 15th of Febuary 2023, at 15:38 (GMT), @fizz#4096 announced his departure from the Rosecord discord,
	"This is my final message to the server, probably forever.
	 Bye everyone ðŸ‘‹"
They left a code in their bio,
	"VsKm4oaRSCLilqxhQApaOgogIEBNd2JrO8Oiw53CqiAgICAgICDDklDilrzDhCnDscK2Rm/DhnU04pmmw6BkIXY="
It is most likely Encrypted Base64. Soon after, he again changed his bio to
	"Back to see more?  https://fizz.red/arg/
	
	Keep an eye out on all that you see. It's not all what it seems, and forms a large part of the puzzle."
https://fizz.red/arg/ led to a page that stated
	"welcome.
	 You found the next step. So here's the documentation for my encryption algorithm. oh yeah, it's not so easy to behold.
	 
	 In the code's cryptic verse, A key and message must immerse. Sixty-nine four twenty doth the key hold, A number so enigmatic, so bold. Each character in the message, a clue, A code to decipher, through and through. For each i, a character must be found, A key char, to which it's bound. To each character, a new life is breathed, A cipher formed, so carefully weaved. For the ord of each char shall be raised, By the key_char, so aptly phased.The message now a mystery, a tale to tell, A story encrypted, for those who delve. With the key so obscure, the code so neat, This encryption is surely hard to beat.

	 If you need another hint, it shall be released on this page. 16th of feb."

It is also important to note that Fizz has another website, https://rizz.zone/ . It is hardcoded to reveal itself at Febuary 17 2023 00:00:00. Source code is availible in this file.

On Wednesday 15th of Febuary 2023, at 16:39 (GMT), @Nukecumber#7829 decoded it as
	"Wow! You decoded the message! The flag is: flag{b4s364lls_4r3_fun}"

As this is being written, no new info has been released. Have fun and solve the Rosecord ARG!
